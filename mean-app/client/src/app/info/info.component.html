            On the first page of our app, we ask for information about your financial situation that is generally constant.
            This includes your rent, grocery budget, savings balance, and other miscellaneous monthly spending.
            We use this information to establish a baseline understanding of your current standard-of-living, which allows us to make comparisons that are tailored to your specific financial needs.

            On the next page of our app, we ask for specific details about the various professional opportunities that you are considering.
            For each opportunity, these details include the location, the income that you would earn, and the type of opportunity that it is (Job, Graduate School, Volunteering, or Self-Employment).
            <br>

            On the next page of our app, we ask for specific details regarding the debt sources that are present in your financial life.
            For each debt source, these details include the principal loan amount, annual interest rate, compound frequency, and monthly payment.
            <br>
            We also ask you to associate each debt with either one specific opportunity or with all of your opportunities.
            For example, if you have current credit card debt that you will carry with you into any opportunity that you pursue, you should classify that debt under "All Opportunities", whereas if you are considering a specific graduate school that would require you to take out a student loan to pay tuition, you should only classify that debt under the opportunity that you created to represent that graduate school.

            The most important page of our app is the Results page, where all of the analysis is displayed.
            This page has several main features.
            <br>
            The first graphic that you will see is a table containing an overall ranking of your opportunities based on affordability.
            Taking into consideration your current standard-of-living, the specifics of each opportunity and debt that you have provided, and the cost-of-living in each of the locations to which you are considering moving, this table ranks your opportunities according to which one will maximize your potential savings account balance.
            <br>
            The next two charts on the page are related to one another; they list your projected debt and projected savings over time. Both of these charts can be viewed over a variable number of months, which you can adjust near the top of the page.
            <br>
            The first chart, which is the debt chart, illustrates the amount that you will owe on the debts that you marked for "All Opportunities" over the next several months as you make your monthly payments.
            <br>
            The second chart, which is the savings chart, illustrates the impact that each opportunity could have on your savings balance. The figures listed here are imperfect, as you will probably deviate from your various monthly budgets slightly, but they should give you a good idea of the general savings trends that each opportunity will make possible for you.
            <br>
            Below these charts is a graph that compares the purchasing power of a dollar in each of the different locations in which your opportunities are located.
            $1 is the national average, lower values indicate less power, and higher values indicate more power.
            <br>
            Below the purchasing power chart is another table that lists data on the average home purchasing price in each of the different locations in which your opportunities are located. This table is generated using data from Zillow, an online real estate database.
            <br>
            The final feature of this page is a collection of Twitter buttons. If you have enjoyed using our product, please Tweet at us or about us and spread the word!

            Purchasing Power: This is the financial ability to buy products and services.
            <br>
            Purchasing power is the value of a currency expressed in terms of the amount of goods or services that one unit of money can buy.
            Practically speaking, if the purchasing power of the dollar in city A is higher than the purchasing power of the dollar in city B, then you will be able to buy more things for the same amount of money in city A than in city B.

            Compound Interest: A debt in which interest is added to the principal amount of the loan; in other words, interest being paid on previous interest.
            <br>
            Compound interest is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than setting it aside in a separate account, so that interest in the next period is then accrued on the principal sum plus the previously accumulated interest.
            Compound interest is common in loans, and whether or not your loan uses compound interest should be stated in the terms of the loan.
            The formula for compound interest is:
            <br>
            P * (1 + (r/n))^(n * t)
            <br>
            where P is the the principal amount of the loan, r is the annual interest rate, n is the compound frequency of the loan, and t is the number of years over which you want to calculate the debt amount.
            <br>
            You can learn more about compound interest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            Simple Interest: A debt in which interest is only calculated on the principal amount of the loan.
            <br>
            In contrast to compound interest, a loan that uses simple interest will only charge you interest on the loan amount, no matter how much interest has previously been accrued or paid off.
            Simple interest is also common in loans, and whether or not your loan uses simple interest should be stated in the terms of the loan.
            The formula for simple interest is:
            <br>
            P * (1 + r * t)
            <br>
            where P is the the principal amount of the loan, r is the annual interest rate, and t is the number of years over which you want to calculate the debt amount.
