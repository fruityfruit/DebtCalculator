        This will be the final page seen when using the debt calculator, right after the Opportunities Comparison Page. This page has two main features. First, it will show the user a "Rank of Opportunities" suggesting certain job or school opportunities, listing their expenses and finally ranking them in order of most to least economical using the data from the "Personal Info Page". Second, it will show specific "Graphs of Data" detailing how much debt they will be in during the oncoming months. <br>
