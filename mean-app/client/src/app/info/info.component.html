    <p class=".text-dark">
      Welcome to the Debt Calculator! This website allows people to determine what their best future opportunity would be financially. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Profile Page</h2>
    <p class=".text-dark">
      In this first page, the user inputs their financial information that is generally constant. This information can include rent, region, monthly payments, etc. This page is to help us determine your current living situation and what your best future opportunity will be. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Opportunity Comparison Page</h2>
    <p class=".text-dark">
      Then, in this page, you give details about any potential future opportunities such as their type, location, and income. You can list these opportunities in any order and we will be able to rank them using the information you gave us in the Profile Page by comparing financial pros and cons of each one. <br> <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Results Page</h2>
    <p class=".text-dark">
      This will be the final page seen when using the debt calculator, right after the Opportunities Comparison Page. This page has two main features. First, it will show the user a "Rank of Opportunities" suggesting certain job or school opportunities, listing their expenses and finally ranking them in order of most to least economical using the data from the "Personal Info Page". Second, it will show specific "Graphs of Data" detailing how much debt they will be in during the oncoming months.
